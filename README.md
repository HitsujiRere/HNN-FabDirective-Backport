# Hostile Neural Networks - Fabrication Directive Backport for Forge 1.20.1

This is a backport of the **Fabrication Directive** feature to Minecraft Forge 1.20.1, based on the original [Hostile Neural Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hostile-neural-networks) mod. Hostile Neural Networks is a mod about defeating hostile simulations to produce loot drops, inspired by Deep Mob Learning.

## New Feature: Fabrication Directive

The Fabrication Directive is a utility item designed to streamline the management of multiple Loot Fabricators. It allows you to store and transfer target selections between machines effortlessly.

### Usage

* Copy Selections: Right-Click on a Loot Fabricator to copy its current target selections into the Directive.
* Apply Selections: Shift + Right-Click on another Loot Fabricator to apply the stored selections.
* Information: Hover over the item in your inventory to see the stored selections, including the input prediction and the resulting loot drop.

## Custom Data Models

You can add custom data models using datapacks and JSON files.
